## Getting Started
In order to run the tests you must complete the following prerequisite steps:
* Install [Git](#install-git)
* Install [Node/NPM](#install-and-nodejs-and-npm)
* (Optional) Install an IDE

### Install Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a version control system that lets you check out code from a repository,
work with that code on your own branch, and then merge that code with any changes that have been made by other developers.
Git is an essential tool for distributed development teams, and is a critical component of the continuous
integration/continuous development toolchain.

##### MacOSX:
1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Under **Downloads**, click **Mac OS X**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.dmg` file open the installer package.
4. Double-click the installer package to begin the installation.
   > *Security Warning*
   >
   > You may see a warning message that the package can't be opened because it's not from a recognized developer.
   If this happens, go to System Preferences > Security and Privacy Settings, and click Open Anyway.
5. Click **Continue** for the installation, and enter your local password to authorize the installation.

##### Windows:
1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Under **Downloads**, click on **Windows**.
3. When the dialog opens asking if you want to allow the app to make changes to your device, click Yes.
4. Follow the steps in the setup wizard to complete the installation. You should accept all the default settings.

### Install and NodeJS and NPM
You’ll need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed.

- Install at least v14 or higher as this is the oldest active LTS version

> **NOTE:**\
> If you don't have Node installed, we recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing 
> multiple active Node.js versions.

If you don't want to install NVM, but the plain version of NodeJS please follow the following steps:

#### MacOSX:
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Under **LTS**, click **Mac OS Installer X**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.pkg` file to open the installer
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

#### Windows:
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Under **LTS**, click **Windows Installer**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.msi` file to open the installer
4. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

### Install dependencies
You can install all dependencies by running the following command

    npm install

This will install all needed dependencies that are listed in the [`package.json`](package.json)-file

> **NOTE:** Make sure you are in root of this project when you execute this command

### Set Environment Variables for Authentication Credentials
This projects relies on the Sauce Labs `username` and `accessKey` that should have been set in the environment variables.
Please check [this](https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/environment-variables/) document on how to set them.

## The project
### Intro
The tests in this repo will show you how to use:
- [Camera/Image injection](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/features/camera-image-injection/#automated-testing)
- [Biometrics](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/features/biometric-authentication/#automated-testing)

Hopefully all code is documented well enough to guide you through the steps you need to take. The used app can be found
[here](apps).

> **NOTE:** If you are asked, for the `Scan a registered device`-flow, to confirm with a passcode, then you need to use `17539`.

### Upload apps to Sauce Labs
You can upload the app, which can be found [here](apps) to Sauce Labs by following 
[these](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/live-testing/live-mobile-app-testing/#uploading-an-app) manual
instructions. 

> **NOTE:** Make sure you upload the apps to your preferred data center.

### QR-codes
The app can use 2 different QR-codes, depending on which option you selected in the first screen. When you selected
*Yes* you selected to register based on an existing *registration* which is running on a different device. You need to
use [this](assets/scan-registered-device.png) QR-code for it

![Scan Registered Device](assets/scan-registered-device.png "Scan Registered Device")

Other wise you need to use [this](assets/scan-account.png) QR-code for it

![Scan Account](assets/scan-account.png "Scan Account")
